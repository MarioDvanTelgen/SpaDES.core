## R CMD check results

There is one *intermittent* error related to a missing tk85.dll on windows R 3.4.3, 32 bit. We have tested it on Windows 32 bit with R 3.4.0 (no error), R 3.4.1  (no error), R 3.4.2 (error) and R 3.4.3 (intermittent error), R 3.5 (R-devel) (no error) Windows, and it only occurs on R 3.4.3 . There is are no other combinations of Windows, Linux, Mac and R-old release, R-release, and R-devel to have the error. The error indicates that tk85.dll is not present; however, tk86.dll *is* present and delivered with R, so there is something in some internals somewhere that is searching for a mismatched dll between the one being requested and the one that is shipped with R. This error is occurring because of the package `RandomFields` from which we import one function.
We feel that this is not something that our package can address.
